# PSSW-Installer

###Note
Make sure that you already have PROS installed and working properly before running this installer. You will need to know the location of the PROS workspace (usually youruserfolder\pros) and the location of the PROS installation (eg C:\Program Files (x86)\PROS) in order to use this installer. This is because the Convex library and other components need to be extracted to the correct directories in order for them to function correctly.
