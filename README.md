# PROS Sensors etup Wizard Installer

###Note
Make sure that you already have PROS installed and working properly before running this installer. You will need to know the location of the PROS workspace (usually youruserfolder\pros) and the location of the PROS installation (eg C:\Program Files (x86)\PROS) in order to use this installer. This is because the plugin needs to be extracted to the PROSe dropins folder.
